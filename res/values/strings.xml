        "        Mary and Joseph went to Bethlehem. It was a long Journey. Mary was soon going to have a baby.

        They arrived in Bethlehem. There was no room for them in the inn. They had to stay in the stable.
        
        That night Mary had her baby. She wrapped him in cloth and put him to sleep in the manger.

        During the night in the fields outside Bethlehem shepherds were guarding their sheep.
        
        Suddenly an angel appered to the shepherds.  All around them was very bright. They were afraid.

        The angel said to them, "Do not be afraid! I have a good news for you. This night Jesus was born in Bethlehem. Go and see him. He is wrapped in cloth and is lying in the manger."
        
        Suddenly a huge number of angels appeared. They sang a hymn praising God. "Glory to God in Heaven. May peace fill the earth. God is with his people."

        After the angels left, the shepherds hurried to Bethlehem.  They wanted to see what the angels had told them about.

        They found Mary and Joseph and saw the baby in the manger.  They were very happy.  Some wise men saw a bright star in the east. They followed the star.

        They carried precious gifts with them to present to Jesus.  They followed the star all the way to Bethlehem. The star stopped over the place where Jesus was.

        The wise men knew that they found Jesus and they were very happy. They went into the house and saw the baby Jesus with his mother Mary. 
        
        The wise men knelt down in front of the baby.  They gave gifts to Jesus. They gave him gold and frankincense and myrh."
